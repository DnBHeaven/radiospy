You'll hear modern and classic rock, world music, electronica, even a bit of classical and jazz. What you won't hear are random computer-generated playlists or mind-numbing commercials.\r\n\r\nOur specialty is taking a diverse assortment of songs and making them flow together in a way that makes sense harmonically, rhythmically, and lyrically \u2014 an art that, to us, is the very essence of radio. We hope that you'll enjoy RP so much that you'll want to share it with your friends, your family, your co-workers, your neighbors ... well you get the idea. ;~)  \r\n\r\nYour grateful hosts, Bill & Rebecca Goldsmith "}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "playlist.channel", "fields": {"stream_url": "http://www.radioparadise.com/musiclinks/rp_64.m3u", "tagline": "", "name": "_default", "producer": 1}}]
